## What?,  Why?, How?

Everyone wants to have a healthy lifestyle; the question is `Is what I'm doing today, good for my tomorrow?`, `Why do I need it?`, and eventually, `Makes sense, but how do I/we get there?`.  I would like to skip past the first two questions above, as your interest in this document already indicates that you're past them and are asking the third question.  `How do I get there?`  ... By eating healthy, working out, having a good social life, peace of mind, and in general, being happy, etc., it goes on.  Each and every one of the above is worth a discussion on its own.  However, leaving the abstract and intagibles aside, I want to focus on how we can leverage technology to achieve this goal.  Let's see how one can use some of the tools available on various platforms today, to keep you motivated towards your fitness goals.

Eating healthy alone can give you good results, but eating healthy coupled with a 30-min work out multiple the results many times over, both physically and mentally.  But what workouts? Where can I find them?  In what order do I do these workouts?  Is this to be done hourly, daily, or one-time only?  Several fitness-centered organizations have made available various tools on the web, on our phones, that can assist us with these questions.

I want to talk about an app that I've found very helpful, called [Myfitnesspal][1].  I use it to count calories, log workouts, track weight, etc.  Among these, personally, I emphasize on counting calories.  I know most people don't count calories, or don't like counting calories, but, personally, it has helped me monitor what and how much I eat.  Tracking that does not have to be accurate.  However, knowing and tracking *what* you eat, *when* or *how often* you eat, and *how much* you eat, has influenced me subconsciously in my decision to pick up my next snack.

## Benefits

There are a myriad of such applications that allow us to invest unbelievably small amount of time regularly, and reap much larger benefits in return.  Let's look at some of these benefits:

1. It enables you to set and track your goals.
2. It allows you to track of your activity level and presents you with pre-configured programs that come with guidelines on how to achieve them.
3. You'll be able to see your progress LIVE right on the app.
4. The more you learn about your habits, the easier it is to be in better control of them.
5. You can customize your workout routine to your convenience on these apps.
6. You no longer have to invest in personal trainers; you have one in your pocket all the time.
7. There are plenty of workouts available *for free*.
8. It motivates you to do a quick 15-min workout at home.
